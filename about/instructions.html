                            GraduDate offers two modes for its users depending on what they are primarily seeking. These

                            seeking Friends, and users seeking Dating will be shown other students seeking Dating. This
                            is done so that it's easier to be upfront about what you and others are seeking on the app.

                            The <i>Report Card</i> displays several measured statistics of a user's behavior on the app.
                            These are:
                            <l>

                            These stats can increase or decrease based on a user's behavior while using the app. They
                            can be viewed before matching to ensure that the user's behavior is acceptable.

                        <p class="text-center">
                            Activity is increased by simply using the app. The more you use the app, the higher your
                            Activity score becomes. Similarly, if you don't use the app very often, your score will
                            drop.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-center">
                            Responsiveness is increased by replying to your matches. When you have a new match or
                            receive a new message, not sending a message to that person will cause your score to drop.
                            Returning messages and starting conversations will increase your score.
                        </p>

                            Thoughtfulness is calculated through message content. Sending lazy, one-word messages will
                            cause your Thoughtfulness score to drop. Sending messages that lead to deeper conversations
                            will increase your score.

                            For each user, all three of these stats are aggregated into a total score (maximum score of
                            4.0). This means users with ideal behavior will have higher scores.

                            filters to show them only other users with a 4.0, or can allow seeing users with 3.0, 2.0,
                            or 1.0. For filtering purposes, users scores are rounded to the nearest whole number

                            If you are aware of a social event on campus, you can create an event and share details.
                            Only users attending the same school as you will be able to see the details for this event,
                            regardless of whether or not <a href="#edit-profile"><i>Field Trip</i></a> is enabled.

                            When creating an event, you will be asked to enter the name of the event, a short
                            description, the location, and time of the event.
                        </p>

                            After an event has been created and is publicly visible, any user can see the details and
                            click the <i>I'm Going</i> button on the top of the screen to indicate their attendance.

                            Any user who views the event will be able to see the full list of who's going. They will
                            also be able to view the profiles of the users attending, but won't be able to send them a
                            message like in Friends mode.
