                    <h1 class="text-center">Just for Students</h1>
                    <p class="text-center">
                        As a student, you are part of an exclusive community. GraduDate is all about letting you connect
                        with that community. The app gives you the option to search for strictly platonic or strictly
                        romantic connections, but gives you the freedom to switch between the two. It even lets you see
                        events on your campus <i>and</i> who's going.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-center">
                        Other apps let you add your school in your profile, and while you'll maybe see someone who goes
                        to your school, you'll see a lot of people who don't. Even if you do see them, there's no
                        guarantee they actually go to your school or if they're even real.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-center">
                        Our account creation process also inherently verifies each user that joins the app. This means
                        <b>no scammers, and no bots.</b> This makes GraduDate safer than nearly every other available
                        social networking app.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-center">
                        Don't you hate it when people on dating apps are "just looking for friends"? Or when you're
                        <i>actually</i> looking for friends and people just want to hook up? That's why GraduDate has
                        two modes for students looking for friends or dating.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-center">
                        Students looking for friends are only shown other
                        students looking for friends, and students looking for dating are only shown other students
                        looking for dating. You're only shown people looking for the same type of connection you are.
                        You can even switch between these two modes whenever you want if you change your mind.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-center">
                        That's why we've implemented a range of features that solve the most common complaints you'll
                        see across every other platform.

                        Our Report Card feature helps keep you from getting ghosted, or getting lazy one-word replies
                        from people who can't hold a conversation. GraduDate also uses a unique matching algorithm to
                        ensure that profiles you see are fresh and active.
