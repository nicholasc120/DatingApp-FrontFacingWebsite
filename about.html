                        Introducing GraduDate, an app built exclusively for connecting post-secondary students
                        interested in making friends or dating.

                        With nearly 10,000 supported universities, you can connect with other students
                        on campus and beyond, as well as create and discover events that are happening at your school.

                        Our app connects college and university students with like-minded individuals at their own
                        school who are also searching for friendship or romance. With two modes available for each,
                        switch between them freely to match with others who share your interests and goals, and start
                        building genuine connections today!

                        GraduDate also offers a range of exciting features that are designed to help you connect with
                        other students and make the most of your time on campus. Our Events feature allows anyone at
                        your school to create and publicize an event, from parties and gatherings to study sessions and
                        club meetings. You can see who's attending these events, connect with other students who share
                        your interests, and even make plans to hang out afterwards.
